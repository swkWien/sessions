# Facilitation Guide

Please read through [the facilitation guide](https://www.coderetreat.org/facilitators/facilitation/#facilitation-advice).

Based on past experience, here a few things to keep in mind as well:
- If you need help with whatever, reach out - your peers are happy to help
- You are responsible for your own session, that includes keeping an eye on the time
- Use inclusive language
  - E.g. avoid "hey guys" (how about just "hey"?)
- For the retrospective:
  - If the group is large: it is not necessary to ask *all* participants
  - You can invite specific people to share their experience
  - Try to invite a newcomers to share their experience
