https://github.com/swkBerlin/ports-and-adapters

> - The application itself does not depend directly on any external systems, but only on ports
> - The protocol for a port is given by the purpose of the conversation it describes
> - For each external system there is an ‘’adapter’’ that converts the API definition to the format needed by that system and vice versa

This is only copy-paste, needs to be updated, as stated too abstract, requires context/background.
