# Follow-up dojo to GDCR

This dojo offers the possibility to focus on the session that was voted most intriguing at 
[GDCR23](https://swkwien.github.io/gdcr23/): Testing **outside-in without mocks**.

Notes on the discussion we had (and the little code we wrote) can be found 
[here](https://github.com/swkWien/kata-bootstraps-gdcr20/tree/2023-11-21-tetris-outside-in/kotlin/junit).

## Slides

The slides were created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a Markdown-oriented publishing system, and rendered locally.

If you want to know more about Quarto, take a look at the official docs regarding

* [presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/) and at the
* [revealjs](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) section if you want to leverage
  specific [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) features for your presentation.

To build/render the slides locally, install quarto, then run the `render.sh` or `render_on_save.sh` scripts
(or use whatever technique you prefer).
