> A **constraint** is something that limits or controls what you can do.

## Baby Steps 👼

1. Setup a timer for 2 minutes interval when you start.
1. Write exactly one test. When the timer rings:
    * test is red => delete and restart.
    * test is green => continue.
1. Restart timer and repeat from 2

Use the same procedure for Refactoring!

## Silent/Mute Ping Pong 🤫

* Like Ping Pong Pairs
* Pairs are not allowed to talk
* The test has to be so expressive that it describe its intention

---

## Evil Coder 👻

* Like Mute Ping Pong Pairs
* Other person is a "lazy evil" programmer
* Implements the code that makes the test pass
* May choose an obscure implementation
* May introduce as much complexity as they wish

---

## Ensemble (Mob) Programming 👨‍👨‍👧‍👧

* Who will facilitate a Mob session?
* Group together and take any room outside
* The facilitators will guide you
