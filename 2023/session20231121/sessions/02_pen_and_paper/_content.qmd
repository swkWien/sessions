## Tetris: Gameplay 🕹️🏗️💯

* Pieces descend onto playing field
* Player arranges pieces to complete lines
* Completed lines disappear and grant points
* Game ends when uncleared lines reach the top
* The more points the better

## Strategy: Pen & Paper 📝🤔💬

Before we start coding, let's think:

* Identify concepts and components
* **Simplify!**
* Make a sketch
* Be explicit
* **Derive test cases**

## Extra Challenge: Explore Directions 🧭🗺️

> How would you implement Tetris?

Inside-Out:

* What is inside?
* How can you drive your implementation outward?

Outside-In:

* What is outside?
* How can you drive your implementation inward?
