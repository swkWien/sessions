Test && commit || revert
------------------------

Run tests often
* Tests are green -> code is committed
* Tests failed -> code is reverted and goes back to green

Process/Increments
* Add some kind of (very small) test passing in some kind of way. (Cheating allowed)
* Once passing, replace fake implementations with real implementation, a little at a time.
