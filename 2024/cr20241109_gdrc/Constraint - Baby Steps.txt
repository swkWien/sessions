Taking Baby Steps
-----------------

1. Set up a timer for certain interval.

2. Write exactly one test
   - If the timer rings and the test is red then *revert*.
   - If the test is green before timer rings then *commit*.

3. Restart timer (no discussions in between timers)

4. Refactor
   - If timer rings and the refactoring is not complete then *revert*.
   - If the refactoring is complete before timer rings then *commit*.

5. Restart the timer (no discussions in between timers)

6. Go to 2 (next test) or 4 (continue refactoring)
