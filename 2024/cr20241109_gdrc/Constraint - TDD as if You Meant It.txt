TDD as if You Meant It
----------------------

* Write exactly one, *simplest*, failing test 

* Add *least code possible* to pass test 
  Add code only inside test method

* Copy the test body to the next test method

* When *duplication* is spotted
  Extract non-test code (extract method)

* New classes only as target for "move method"

* Refactor as required
