Test Driven Development
-----------------------

Write a failing test
Make the test pass
Refactor


Uncle Bob’s 3 Laws of TDD
-------------------------

You are not allowed to write any ...

... production code unless to make a failing test pass.
... more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail the test.
... more production code than is sufficient to pass the test.
